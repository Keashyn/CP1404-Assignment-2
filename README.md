_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The entire project took me 16 days with 2 hours per day.

Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am satified with what i have learned from this assignment is on how to make classes and assign them to other classes
and also make a simple application.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am least satified with this assignment is that the instruction that was given in the assignemnt need to more detailed 
and easy to undersatnd.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The work that worked well for me is that changing the functions from assignment 1 into methods for assignmnet 2.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I would like to improve my planning on how to make the applications and there requirements that are needed.
In this assignmnet i was struggling to make the applications into 3 classes and what i did was only made 2 classes
based on the instruction that was givien in the assignment.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
The learning resources i used was the practicals and the internet. The practiacls that i used to see where to start the code like square.kv and square.py
The internet was used for finding definitions and what they mean so that i can understand it proprtly.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge of this assignmnet is that how to change terminal or text display into real applications
and  how to used kivy and convert to the 3 main class files.
I overcome this problem by changing the function that i have made in assignment 1 into a method and then use the kivy 
template so that it can print functions and to see the method was working.
I also try to learn the kivy from lecture slides, practicals and the interent and by going over through the practicals from 7-8.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
 The experience of using classes was interesting to me because i never coded an application before and it did help improve
 my code so that it can run smoothly when a user runs the app.
